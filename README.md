<h1>Problem Statement:</h1>
<p>In today's fast-paced world, where urbanization is on the rise and green spaces are diminishing, there is a growing need for accessible platforms that promote sustainable practices, community engagement, and healthy lifestyles. Lack of access to fresh, nutritious food and limited opportunities for outdoor activities contribute to various societal challenges, including food insecurity, poor physical and mental health, and environmental degradation.

Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of self-sufficiency and community resilience, driving a renewed interest in activities like gardening as a means of sustainable living and fostering connections within communities.

<h1>Introducing GreenThumb:</h1>
GreenThumb is a community gardening application aimed at empowering individuals and communities to cultivate green spaces, grow their own food, and connect with like-minded enthusiasts. By providing a comprehensive suite of features and resources, GreenThumb addresses the following challenges and opportunities:

<h1>Challenges:</h1>

  1. Limited Access to Fresh, Nutritious Food

GreenThumb aims to address this challenge by promoting local food production through community gardening initiatives, enabling users to grow their own fruits, vegetables, and herbs.

Busy lifestyles and digital distractions contribute to social isolation and a decline in face-to-face interactions within communities.
GreenThumb provides a platform for users to connect with others who share their passion for gardening, fostering meaningful relationships and collaborative projects.

3. Limited Green Spaces and Environmental Degradation:
Rapid urbanization and land development lead to the loss of green spaces and biodiversity, contributing to environmental degradation and climate change.
GreenThumb encourages the creation of green spaces within urban areas, promoting sustainable land use practices and biodiversity conservation.
